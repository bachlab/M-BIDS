What is M-BIDS
======================
M-BIDS is a data standardization philosophy built on top of BIDS. It introduces stricter guidelines tailored to individual experiment types.

Experimental data analysis often requires key metadata. While BIDS provides ways to store such metadata, its flexibility leads to variability. This variability creates friction when developing automated analysis pipelines.

M-BIDS (Machine-interpretable BIDS) addresses this by ensuring data is not only machine-readable, as BIDS intended, but also machine-interpretable.

This document provides specific rules for metadata storage, column naming, and other conventions based on experiment type.
