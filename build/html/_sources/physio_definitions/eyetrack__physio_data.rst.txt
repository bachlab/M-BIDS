“Eyetrack” Physio Data
======================

Directory Structure
.. code-block:: text

    Where <matches> corresponds to sub-<label>[ses-<label>]_task-<label> before the suffix.  For example, <matches> corresponds to sub-01_ses-1_task-FearAcquisition for the file 
    sub-01_ses-1_task-FearAcquisition_recording-eye1_physio.tsv.

Eyetracker data MUST follow  in terms of required columns and json metadata.

In addition, it is RECOMMENDED to store the detailed eyetracker geometry for pupil foreshortening error correction:
All distances in standard unit of distance measurement: meters.

Here, 
           X axis is the axis running along the screen’s width,
           Y axis is the axis that runs along the screen’s height, and
           Z axis is the axis along which the eye, camera and the screen are located.
