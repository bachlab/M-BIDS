Event Definitions
=================

Task events for behavioral experiments are saved as ``events.tsv`` and ``events.json`` files (see `BIDS Specification/Task Events <https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/modality-specific-files/task-events.html>`_). In addition to the event definitions provided in the BIDS specification, we REQUIRE the following data columns: 

.. list-table:: Table 1: Required additional columns in events definitions
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 25 25 25 25 

   * - Column
     - Description
     - Data Type
     - Example
   * - ``event_type``
     - Type of event, expressed as a character string.
     - String
     - ``CS``, ``US``. ``CS1p``, ...
   * - ``stimulus_name``
     - Name of the stimulus.
     - String
     - ``picture``, ``sound``, ...

Additional guidelines are different for different experiment types and are listed below:
