Event definitions for Fear Conditioning experiments
===================================================

Fear conditioning experiments involve **conditioned stimuli (CS)** and **unconditioned aversive stimuli (US)** events. CS that are reinforced by a following US trial are typically referred to as **CS+** while CS that are not reinforced are typically referred to as **CS-**.

Every event in the experiment **MUST** follow this naming pattern: ``<event_type><ID><polarity>``

Where:
    - `event_type` is either ``CS`` or ``US``
    - `ID` is a numeric identifier for the stimulus.
    - `polarity` is:
        - ``p`` for positive/reinforced (CS+)
        - ``m`` for negative/non-reinforced (CS-)

For example, in an experiment with one CS+, one CS-, and one US, the valid event names would be: ``CS1p, CS2m, US``

An example ``events.tsv`` file would look like this

.. code-block:: text

    onset	duration	event_type	stimulus_name	task_name
    10.0	8.0	        CS1m            diamond	        habituation
    25.0	8.0	        CS2p            square	        habituation
    40.0	8.0	        CS1m            diamond     	habituation
    55.0	8.0	        CS2p	        square          acquisition
    62.5	0.5	        US	        shock           acquisition
    70.0	8.0	        CS1m            diamond	        acquisition
